# Ensemble-based Monocular Depth Estimation with Diffusion and Transformer Fusion via Felzenszwalb-Guided Refinement

## Methodology

### 1. Problem Formulation

Given an RGB image $I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$, we generate:
- $D_m$: Depth map predicted by **Marigold**
- $D_d$: Depth map predicted by **Depth Anything V2**, converted from disparity to affine-invariant depth

### 2. Felzenszwalb Segmentation

We apply Felzenszwalbâ€™s graph-based segmentation algorithm to partition the image into consistent regions:

```math
S = \text{Felzenszwalb}(I, \text{scale}=200, \sigma=0.8, \text{min\_size}=50)
````

Each unique value in $S \in \mathbb{Z}^{H \times W}$ represents a segment.

### 3. Segment-Based Feature Extraction

For each segment $P_i$, we extract:

* Mean depth $\mu_i$
* Depth variance $\sigma^2_i$
* Confidence $c_i = \frac{1}{\sigma_i + \epsilon}$, with $\epsilon = 10^{-9}$

These are computed for both depth maps $D_m$ and $D_d$, yielding:

* $F^m_i = \{\mu^m_i, (\sigma^m_i)^2, c^m_i\}$
* $F^d_i = \{\mu^d_i, (\sigma^d_i)^2, c^d_i\}$

### 3. Adaptive Depth Fusion

For each segment $P_i$, we compute the confidence ratio:

```math
R = \frac{c^d_i}{c^m_i + \epsilon}
```

We then apply the following rules:

* If the segment is flat ($\mu_i \approx 1.0$, $\sigma^2_i < 0.001$), set output depth to 1.0
* Else, if $R > T$ (with $T = 1.2$), use Depth Anything V2
* Otherwise, use Marigold

This ensures that the fusion respects regions of high confidence and selectively incorporates information from Depth Anything V2 where it clearly outperforms Marigold.
